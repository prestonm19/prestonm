    <p>In this rotation, we did vaccum forming, and made skateboards. Unfotunately, the vaccum bag I had did not seal prperly, and as such it did not form or hold together properly. Luckily, I was able to salvage it by glueing the edges down and putting it in clamps overnight. After glueing the sides backtogether, I sanded off the extra glue, trimmed the edges, added stickers to the bottom, and sealed it with a clear coat.</p>
