    <h1 style="background-color:#efbeee;"> Printing</h1>
    <p>In this unit we focused on various types of printing. This included garment printing, UV printing, and sublimation printing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For garment printing, I created a t-sht of an outline of Ohio with the Western Resere Academy logo inside of it. The hardest challenge of this was getting a high quality version of the WRA logo into CorelDraw, which I eventually acomplished by turing the Logo into a bitmap.</p>

    <p>For the UV printing, I printed on a popsocket. I had misjudged the size of my image, which resulted in the image not fully fitting on the popsocket. It was mostly on the popsocket, however, and was printed properly.</p>

    <p>For sublimaation printing, I printed on a neopreme pencil pouch. I had to becareful suring the transfer because after being put in the heat press, it was hot to handle and I had to avoid toughing the zipper so I wouldn't be burned. Thankfully, I managed to not burn myself and the design transfereed with no problems.</p>
