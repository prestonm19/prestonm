    <h1 style="background-color:#efbeee;"> Printing</h1>
    <p>In this unit we focused on various types of printing. This included garment printing, UV printing, and sublimation printing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For garment printing, I created a t-sht of an outline of Ohio with the Western Resere Academy logo inside of it. The hardest challenge of this was getting a high quality version of the WRA logo into CorelDraw, which I eventually acomplished by turing the Logo into a bitmap.</p>
