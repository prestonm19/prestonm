    <p>This rotation we started working with 3d modeling, using the program Autodesk Fusion 360.</p>
    <br>
    <p> To start, we had to make six models from a set of fifty. It took me a bit to learn how to read the designs, but once I figured it out it was very easy to build what I needed to.</p>
