    <h1 style="background-color:#efbeee;"> Final Project</h1>
    <p>For my project, I essentially created a cardboard doll house. I designed a house in Fusion360, exported the sketches to corel draw, and then cut out the pieces laser cutter. I ened up having to design the house twice because the joints didn't fit together properly the first time. Next, I designed furniture in Fusion 360, and 3d printed.I desined a chair, a bed, a couch, and two tables. Unfortunately, one of the tables snapped in hald as I was removing it from the raft. I then made a box to store all the furniture in. I glued the house and box together, and placed the furniture inside.</p>
